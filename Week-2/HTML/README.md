# Week 2

In Week 2, I focused on learning HTML and CSS.
## HTML
In the HTML section, I learned that HTML is a markup language used to define the structure of a webpage.
The topics I covered include: 
- Title, Heading, and paragraph
- Meta tags
- Comments
- Heading tags
- Line break and horizontal tags
- Different types of lists in HTML
- Images in HTML
- Tables in HTML
- Different types of input tags
- Aria-labels
- Semantic tags 
- Videos in HTML

Additionally, I  learned about other commonly used tags like anchor, bold, and underline tags.

**Note**: I did not memorize the syntax, but I focused on understanding how each element works and its importance..
