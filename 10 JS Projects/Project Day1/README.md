This is my first project of 10 days JS Small project Series.In this project i have to set up digitial timer which starts automatically when page refreshes . It also update the data dynamically.
In this Project i came to know about many new Concepts of JS. First i learn about the Date object of JS

 ## Date 
  Date objects are used to works with date and time . It represents a specific time like March 14, 2025, at 10:30 AM. For example , if create a date object JS will store date as a number , this is the number of how many milliseconds are passed since January 1st ,1970 from that moment.
